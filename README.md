# Kubernetes Basics

## What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** (also known as **K8s**) is an open-source platform designed to **automate the deployment, scaling, and operation** of application containers.


## In Simple Terms

Kubernetes is like a robot manager that:

- Deploys your app containers
- Keeps them running
- Replaces them if they crash
- Scales them up or down when needed


## Why Use Kubernetes?

- Automates deployment and scaling
- Handles app crashes automatically
- Simplifies managing containerized workloads
- Runs containers reliably across multiple machines


## Key Concepts

| Concept     | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pod**     | The smallest unit in Kubernetes, usually contains one or more containers.  |
| **Service** | A stable endpoint to access a set of Pods. Handles load balancing.         |
| **Deployment** | Manages updates and scaling of Pods. Enables zero-downtime deployments. |
| **Node**    | A machine (VM or physical) that runs Pods.                                 |
| **Cluster** | A group of Nodes managed by Kubernetes.                                    |
| **Namespace** | Organizes resources into logical groups.                                |
| **Ingress** | Manages external access to Services (HTTP routing).                       |


## Features of Kubernetes

- ✅ **Container orchestration**
- 🔁 **Self-healing containers**
- 📈 **Automatic scaling**
- 🔄 **Rolling updates**
- 🔐 **Secret & config management**
- 🌍 **Multi-cloud & hybrid support**


## Real-World Analogy

> Kubernetes is like a **warehouse manager** for **robots (containers)**. It:
> - Tracks them
> - Fixes them if they fail
> - Sends tasks to the right robots
> - Replaces outdated robots with new ones—without stopping the work


## Docker vs Kubernetes

| Feature               | Docker                     | Kubernetes               |
|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Purpose               | Runs containers            | Orchestrates containers   |
| Handles scaling?      | ❌ Manual                  | ✅ Automatic               |
| Self-healing?         | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                    |
| Load balancing?       | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                    |
| Multi-node management | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                    |
